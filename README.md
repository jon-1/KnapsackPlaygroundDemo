# KnapsackPlaygroundDemo
Implementation of the knapsack problem in Swift 

This is designed to solve this particular hypothetical problem: 

You're going on a camping trip with your roommate. You're both travelling separately and your roommate asks you to leave them a note before you go of what supplies they should gather to bring along. You're running late - your bus arrives in minutes and you have to quickly jot down the supplies - all of which exist in your in your mind, clearly ranked in order of importance. Unforuntately, you notice the pen has very low ink and you estimate you'll only be able to write about 30 letters before it goes dry. 

You need to quickly determine which words to commit to the note while maximizing the value of the conveyed items. Each item carries a value equal to its rank in the list in your head - 'water canteen' is first out of 14 items, so it's worth 14 points. 'dried food' is second out of 14, so it's worth 13 points, et cetera, down to 'whistle' which is last and worth 1 point. You can't write partial words or abbreviate - you know your roommate wouldn't get it.
